# TicTacToe
TicTacToe with js

new.js is the first js file that i had created, in that file there is lot of repetetive code.
new1.js is the improvement over new.js file i.e. repetetive code is less.
new2.js is the final js file which is optimised as much as possible with es6 features and remove some more redundancy.
